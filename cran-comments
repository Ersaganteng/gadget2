==== 2.3.4

This package compiles & installs Gadget, a C++-based marine ecosystem modelling
framework. Whilst Gadget itself is a standalone executable, this is a first
step to releasing Rgadget[github.com/hafro/rgadget], an R front end that wraps
and extends core Gadget.

This is a re-submission, to fix the following comments:

* Mark G. Johnson still is not credited.

He has been added to Authors@R, and inst/COPYRIGHTS

* Please omit unneeded quotes in your description, as they are used to indicate
  packages, paper titles, non-English usage etc. --> to real data

Quotes have been removed
